# Hacksource
Hacksource is a place for software developers to find and share the most helpful resources for getting unstuck

Slack is great for communicating, but it’s no so great for sharing resources that quickly get lost In the shuffle of new posts and giphys. Not only does Hacksource keep resources perfectly organized using meaningful categories and custom tags, it also allows students to upvote what they found most helpful so that the “best of the best” resources are also easiest to find.
